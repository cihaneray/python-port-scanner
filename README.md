## Features

- **Multiple scanning techniques**: TCP Connect, SYN, and UDP scanning
- **Flexible target specification**: Scan individual hosts, IPs, or entire subnets using CIDR notation
- **Versatile port selection**: Scan single ports, port ranges, comma-separated port lists, or all ports
- **Performance optimized**: Multithreaded scanning for improved speed
- **Service identification**: Automatic detection of common services on open ports
- **Banner grabbing**: Identify specific service versions running on open ports
- **Real-time feedback**: Progress reporting with estimated time remaining
- **Output options**: Save results as plain text or JSON format
- **Customizable settings**: Adjustable timeouts, thread counts, and retry attempts
- **Detail control**: Verbose and quiet modes for different output levels
- **Service database**: Customizable port service definitions via external configuration

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- For SYN and UDP scanning:
  - Root/Administrator privileges
  - Scapy library
- No external dependencies for basic TCP Connect scanning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-port-scanner.git
   cd advanced-port-scanner
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```shell
   chmod +x port_scanner.py
   ```

3. For SYN and UDP scanning, install the Scapy library:
   ```shell
   # For Windows and macOS
   pip install scapy
   
   # For Linux
   pip3 install scapy
   
   # For Debian/Ubuntu systems
   sudo apt install python3-scapy
   ```

## Usage

```
./port_scanner.py [-h] [-t THREADS] [-T TIMEOUT] [-o OUTPUT] [-v] [-q] [-b] [-s] [-u]
                  [--json] [--config CONFIG] [--udp-retry UDP_RETRY] hosts ports
```

### Required Arguments

- `hosts`: Target host(s) to scan (hostname, IP address, or CIDR notation)
- `ports`: Port specification in one of these formats:
  - Single port: `80`
  - Port range: `20-25`
  - Comma-separated list: `22,80,443,8080`
  - All ports: `-`

### Options

- `-h, --help`: Show help message and exit
- `-t, --threads THREADS`: Number of threads to use (default: 50)
- `-T, --timeout TIMEOUT`: Timeout in seconds (default: 0.5)
- `-o, --output OUTPUT`: Output file for results
- `-v, --verbose`: Verbose output (shows ports as they're discovered)
- `-q, --quiet`: Suppress all output except results
- `-b, --banner`: Attempt to grab banners from open ports
- `-s, --syn`: Use SYN scanning (requires root/admin privileges)
- `-u, --udp`: Perform UDP scanning (requires root/admin privileges)
- `--json`: Output results in JSON format
- `--config CONFIG`: Path to custom port configuration file
- `--udp-retry UDP_RETRY`: Number of retries for UDP scanning (default: 3)

## Scanning Techniques

### TCP Connect Scan (Default)
- Completes the full TCP three-way handshake
- More detectable but works without special privileges
- Compatible with all systems and network configurations

### SYN Scan
- Only sends SYN packets without completing the handshake
- Stealthier and faster than TCP Connect scans
- Requires root/admin privileges and the Scapy library
- May be blocked by some firewalls

### UDP Scan
- Tests for open UDP ports by sending empty UDP packets
- Relies on ICMP "port unreachable" messages for closed ports
- Less reliable than TCP scanning due to the connectionless nature of UDP
- Requires root/admin privileges and the Scapy library
- Multiple retries are used to improve accuracy

## Examples

Scan a specific port:
```shell
./port_scanner.py example.com 80
```

Scan a range of ports with SYN scan (requires root):
```shell
sudo ./port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 20-25 -s
```

Scan multiple specific ports:
```shell
./port_scanner.py scanme.nmap.org 22,80,443
```

Scan all ports with 100 threads:
```shell
./port_scanner.py scanme.nmap.org - -t 100
```

Scan an entire subnet for SSH servers:
```shell
./port_scanner.py 192.168.1.0/24 22
```

Scan with banner grabbing:
```shell
./port_scanner.py 10.0.0.1 20-30 -b
```

Combined UDP and TCP scan with banner grabbing:
```shell
sudo ./port_scanner.py 192.168.1.10 1-1000 -s -u -b
```

Save scan results to a file in JSON format:
```shell
./port_scanner.py example.com 80-443 -o results --json
```

## Port Configuration

The scanner uses a port configuration file in JSON format to identify services. A default configuration is included, but you can customize it:

```json
{
  "common_ports": {
    "20": "FTP-DATA",
    "21": "FTP",
    "22": "SSH",
    "23": "TELNET",
    "25": "SMTP",
    "53": "DNS",
    "80": "HTTP",
    "110": "POP3",
    "143": "IMAP",
    "443": "HTTPS",
    "3306": "MySQL",
    "3389": "RDP"
  }
}
```

Place this file in the same directory as the script or specify a custom path with the `--config` option.

## Performance Optimization

- SYN scanning is generally faster than TCP Connect scanning
- UDP scanning is slower and less reliable than TCP-based methods
- Increasing thread count improves speed but consumes more system resources
- Reducing timeout values speeds up scans but may increase false negatives
- For large networks or wide port ranges, consider scanning in smaller batches

## Limitations

- SYN and UDP scanning require root/administrator privileges and the Scapy library
- Banner grabbing may not work with all services or protocols
- UDP scanning has inherent reliability issues due to the protocol's design
- The scanner does not perform OS fingerprinting or vulnerability detection
- Limited IPv6 support
